# AOS
Arduino Operating System

The sketch shows how the arduino can operate interactivly via the serial interface.

Once you install AOS you will most likely make it the platform to build from.  You can add your own commands and functions.  Once you program the code, use hyperterminal or any other terminal emulator program and connect at 9600 baud.  You will see a prompt AOS>.  At this prompt you can enter "?" and this will pull up the menue with all the available commands.  The commands are not case sensative.
